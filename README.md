#things i would improve

definitely would spend more time on UX design

Add localization  - i18next 

Add Error boundary

Better Zero state component

Menu items could be rewritten - Styled components

Api looks like handling special characters pretty well , else would add any injection stoppers/validation.

Mobile view looks to be ok , definitely can improve on that adding media queries for various width
